            <p><b>Hi, my name is Ykisha Jarel L. Orio. My age is sixteen years. I am currently living in the United Arab Emirates with my parents and younger brother. In Far Eastern Private School, I am in class 8. Prior to the epidemic, I enjoyed attending to school to see my classmates and learn new things. My best friends' names are Altaire and Charinamae. Despite the epidemic, I attempt to join in some of my school's extracurricular activities and try to do my best.</b></p>

            <p><b>Math and Science-Biology are my favorite subjects. My hobbies include reading, binge-watching, do-it-yourself projects, origami, cross-stitching, embroidery, and photography. I also help my parents with household chores and anytime my friends and classmates want help with anything, whether it's studying or something else.</b></p>
